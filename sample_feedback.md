### Review and Feedback

Your submission for the Cybersecurity Programming Task is comprehensive and demonstrates a good understanding of the assignment requirements. Let's go through each exercise and provide feedback:

#### Exercise 1: Understanding Randomness in Java (Theoretical)
- You haven't included your answers for this exercise. Make sure to research and document the differences between `java.util.Random` and `java.security.SecureRandom`. Understanding these differences is crucial for secure key generation.

#### Exercise 2: Ternary Operator in Decision Making (Theoretical)
- Similar to Exercise 1, please ensure you've provided your explanation and the rewritten conditional using the ternary operator. This will help consolidate your understanding of concise conditional logic.

#### Exercise 3: Secure Data Copying (Coding)
- **Implementation**: Your implementation of both shallow and deep copy methods is correct. You demonstrated how changes to the shallow copy affect the original array, while changes to the deep copy do not.
- **Suggestion**: You might want to discuss the implications of using shallow and deep copies in terms of memory usage and performance, especially in the context of cybersecurity.

#### Exercise 4: Bug Hunting in Security Code (Coding)
- **Corrections**: You fixed the loop start index and handled encryption correctly by considering both uppercase and lowercase letters. This ensures that non-alphabetic characters are untouched, which is a good practice.
- **Suggestion**: Consider edge cases, such as negative keys or very large positive keys, and how they affect the encryption. Additionally, ensure that null input is handled gracefully, which you've addressed.

#### Exercise 5: Using Iterators for Safe Collection Modification (Coding Challenge)
- **Implementation**: Your method for removing expired sessions using an `Iterator` is correct. This prevents `ConcurrentModificationException`, ensuring safe collection modification.
- **Suggestion**: Consider adding unit tests to verify the functionality of this code, which is a good practice in production-level code.

#### Exercise 6: Inheritance in Secure Programming (Optional Challenge)
- **Implementation**: You effectively used inheritance to create a `SecureData` base class, with `Credentials` and `ApiToken` extending it. This reduces code duplication and enhances maintainability.
- **Suggestion**: You could explore adding common security methods in `SecureData`, such as logging access or validating data integrity, which would further demonstrate the power of inheritance.

### General Comments
- **Code Quality**: Your code is well-structured and follows good naming conventions. The use of `StringBuilder` for message encryption is efficient.
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: Ensure that all exercises are completed, including theoretical questions, as they're integral to understanding the concepts.
- **Advanced Topics**: Consider exploring Java's concurrency features, which are important for secure and efficient applications. Also, delve into Java's cryptographic libraries beyond `SecureRandom`, such as `Cipher`.

Overall, your submission is solid and demonstrates a good grasp of the task objectives. Ensure to complete all parts of the assignment, especially the theoretical sections, to fully meet the requirements. Keep up the good work!
